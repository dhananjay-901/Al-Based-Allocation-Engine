Background

The PM Internship Scheme enables students to gain industry exposure through structured internships. However, matching thousands of applicants with the most suitable opportunities remains a challenge, often leading to suboptimal selections and delays.

Description

The problem envisages a smart, automated system that uses AI/ML algorithms to match candidates with internship opportunities based on skills, qualifications, location preferences, and sector interests. The system should also account for affirmative action (e.g., representation from rural/aspirational districts, different social categories), past participation, and internship capacity of industries.

Expected Solution

A functional prototype with:
• AI-based matchmaking engine for internship placement
• A prototype of the front end demonstrating how this engine will work
